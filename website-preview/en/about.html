			<h2>Transform academic research into state of the art solutions</h2>

			<p>Building on transformative research in inverse problems and volatility determination, significant real-world impacts have been achieved across the financial services and steel industries. In the financial sector, we have successfully incorporated the researchers' volatility determination algorithms [1, 2] into its proprietary trading platform. The integration of advanced option pricing models featuring physics-informed regularization of Black-Scholes and Heston PDEs [3, 4] has yielded impressive results in back-tested scenarios. Clients using the enhanced platform have experienced portfolio return improvements of 12 to 18%, underscoring the tangible value of precise volatility modeling in derivatives trading.</p>
			
			<p>Professor Hon has been appointed as a visiting professor by the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University. He is providing consultation services for a research project supported by <a href = "https://www.plastics-rubber.es/en/exhibitor/moldex3d-2/" target = "new">Moldex3D</a> (Taiwan Branch), a world-leading CAE product for the plastic molding industry. This collaboration has led to the integration of the volatility determination algorithm with cutting-edge AI-based techniques [4], offering innovative solutions that highlight both theoretical foundations and practical implications. Our goal is to explore a wide range of domains where AI is transforming industries and delivering significant contributions.</p>

			<p>Recently, we adapted this AI-based inverse determination method for medical imaging problems, which represents just one subset of the broad spectrum of AI applications. This research is being conducted in collaboration with Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The partnership began in June 2023, and the medical data used for verification was provided by the hospital. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the AI-based inverse determination method can significantly enhance the reconstruction of 3D/4D medical images, even when compared to traditional methods that do not incorporate AI techniques.</p>
