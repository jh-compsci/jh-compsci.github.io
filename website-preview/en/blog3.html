			<h2>1. Gifted children are smart, so they can succeed on their own</h2> 
			<p>When students are not given learning experiences that match their abilities, they lose motivation - sometimes even their interest in learning and school. Brain research suggests that without challenge, the brain does not maintain its level of development.</p>
			
			<h2>2. Gifted students excel in all school subjects</h2>
			<p>While some students are high achievers in every subject, many others have strengths in specific areas. Gifted students may struggle in some subjects while excelling in others. Some may even have learning disabilities - a phenomenon known as twice-exceptionality.</p>

			<h2>3. Gifted students are a homogeneous group</h2>
			<p>Like any other group, gifted students have diverse interests, strengths, ability levels, and temperaments. There is no single checklist of gifted traits, nor will the same strategies meet all students’ needs. Differentiated instruction is essential, even in advanced classes.</p>

			<h2>4. All Gifted Students Love School and Excel Academically</h2>
			<p>Many gifted students disengage from school due to lack of challenge, mismatch with teaching styles, or social-emotional struggles (e.g., feeling "different"). Some may even underachieve to fit in or rebel against pressure. Giftedness doesn’t guarantee academic success - it requires the right environment to thrive.</p>			

			<h2>5. All children are gifted</h2>
			<p>This belief is well-intentioned, and it’s true that all children can learn and have their own strengths. However, some students learn more quickly and are capable of work beyond their age level. Gifted students require different content and instruction to meet their needs.</p>
