			<h2>Transform academic research into industry</h2>

			<p>We incorporated modern volatility determination algorithms into its proprietary trading platform, featuring physics-informed regularization of Black-Scholes and Heston PDEs and yielded impressive results in back-tested scenarios. Our clients using the enhanced platform have experienced portfolio return improvements up to 18%, underscoring the tangible value of precise volatility modeling in derivatives trading.</p>
			
			<p>Professor Hon has been appointed as a visiting professor by the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University. He provides consultation services for a research project supported by <a href = "https://www.plastics-rubber.es/en/exhibitor/moldex3d-2/" target = "new">Moldex3D</a>, a world-leading CAE product for the plastic molding industry. This collaboration has led to the integration of the volatility determination algorithm with cutting-edge AI-based techniques [4], offering innovative solutions that highlight both theoretical foundations and practical implications. Our goal is to explore a wide range of domains where AI is transforming industries and delivering significant contributions.</p>

			<p>We adapted this AI-based inverse determination method for medical imaging problems, which represents just one subset of the broad spectrum of AI applications. This research is being conducted in collaboration with Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the AI-based inverse determination method can significantly enhance the reconstruction of 3D/4D medical images compared to traditional methods.</p>
			

			<h2>Gifted Education</h2>
			<p>Professor Hon had initiated a pioneering university-wide project to develop university short courses for students of the Hong
				Kong Academy of Gifted Education (HKAGE). The programme, entitled “Talent,
				Aspiration, and Excellence (TAE)”, was funded by the HKAGE and had run for two
				years in 2017 and 2018. The short courses of TAE covered different subjects
				including mathematics, solar energy, mechanical motion animation, English
				communication, and business strategy. Affective education was incorporated in the
				TAE programme to enhance emotional regulation of students. A total of about 150
				students of the HKAGE participated in the TAE with very good outcomes according
				to feedbacks from both HKAGE and the participants.</p>
